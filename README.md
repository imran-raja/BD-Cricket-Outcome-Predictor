## Bangladesh ODI Cricket Match Outcome Predictive Model

### This is the Python implementation of the results shown in the paper "Prediction of Final Result of One Day International Cricket Match: A Machine Learning Approach".

Historical data of 71 ODI matches of Bangladesh from 2009 to mid 2017 was collected from espncricinfo.com.

The following five major supervised machine learning algoritms were used:

1. k Nearest Neighbor
2. Logistic Regression
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Random Forest
5. Extreme Gradient Boosting

A comparision of the results obtained from the above mentioned algorithms is shown below:
